# Section-9-SIEM
SIEM for Software Engineering

Things to work on:

Ryan
  - Create user authentication system
  - Organize filesystem to extract zip into each user's file


BTW editing the file is nano will NOT add any spaces, so edit it in another editor, if that doesn't work you can edit it on the website
