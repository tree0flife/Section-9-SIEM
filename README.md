# Section-9-SIEM
SIEM for Software Engineering

Things to work on:

Ryan
  - Create user authentication system
  - Organize filesystem to extract zip into each user's file

Stefan
  - Error handling. LOTS OF ERROR HANDLING.
  - Make Client a Service
  - Implement tear.py 

BTW editing the file is nano will NOT add any spaces, so edit it in another editor, if that doesn't work you can edit it on the website
