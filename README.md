# Section-9-SIEM
SIEM for Software Engineering

Things to work on:

Ryan
  - Fix the downloading of a zip file
  - Create user authentication system
  - Organize filesystem to extract zip into each user's file

BTW editing the file is nano will NOT add any spaces, so edit it in another editor, if that doesn't work you can edit it on the website
